Please note, that Codeforces only calculates time consumed by your process, while CrossRun may take up to several minutes, it does not necessarily mean you will get TL.

Some subset of tests is located in tests directory.

To test your solution with interator, run "run-crossrun.bat"/"run-crossrun.sh" with two parameters - test filename and command line for running your solution.

For example:
	run-crossrun.bat 01 solution.exe
	run-crossrun.bat 01 "java Solution"
